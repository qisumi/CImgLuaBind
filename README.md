# CImgLuaBind(CILB)

## Motivation
For our Digit Image Processing(DIG) Labs, we usually adjust the parameters repeatedly and compile the C++ codes repeatedly, which cost lots of time and tiresome.

So I just write some basic functions to process image in C++ and bind it to lua. So that we don't have to compile and process images almost as fast as C++.

In lua you can
- process images by calling functions offered by CILB including
    1. load img from file
    2. pixel and channel level control
    3. display image, save image in file
    4. etc
- What's more, we can also offer some functions in CILB.
    1. filter
    2. conv
    3. blur
    4. etc
- Also some batch processing functions.
    1. sin
    2. abs
    3. max
    4. min
    5. etc
